# Security Review - Steplo Marketplace

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented and tested in the Steplo Marketplace application.

## Authentication & Authorization

### Implementation

- Supabase Authentication for secure user management
- JWT-based session handling
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Protected API routes with middleware validation

### Testing Results

✅ User registration flow
✅ Login/logout functionality
✅ Password reset process
✅ Session management
✅ Role-based access restrictions

## Data Protection

### API Security

- All endpoints use HTTPS
- API rate limiting implemented
- Request validation middleware
- CORS configuration properly set
- API keys stored in environment variables

### Database Security

- Row Level Security (RLS) in Supabase
- Prepared statements for queries
- Input sanitization
- Data encryption at rest

## Frontend Security Measures

### Input Validation

- Client-side validation with proper error messages
- Server-side validation as backup
- XSS prevention through proper escaping
- File upload restrictions and validation

### State Management

- Secure storage of sensitive data
- Proper handling of authentication tokens
- Protection against CSRF attacks
- Secure form handling

## Security Testing Results

### Penetration Testing

1. **SQL Injection**

   - Status: ✅ Protected
   - Implementation: Parameterized queries

2. **XSS Attacks**

   - Status: ✅ Protected
   - Implementation: Content Security Policy (CSP)

3. **CSRF Attacks**

   - Status: ✅ Protected
   - Implementation: Anti-CSRF tokens

4. **Authentication Bypass**
   - Status: ✅ Protected
   - Implementation: Proper session validation

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Password Security**

   - Strong password requirements
   - Secure password hashing
   - Brute force protection

2. **Session Management**

   - Secure session handling
   - Proper timeout configuration
   - Session invalidation on logout

3. **Error Handling**
   - Generic error messages to users
   - Detailed logging for debugging
   - No sensitive data in error responses

## Recommendations

1. **Short Term**

   - Implement two-factor authentication
   - Add security headers
   - Enhance logging system

2. **Long Term**
   - Regular security audits
   - Automated security testing
   - Security awareness training

## Conclusion

The application has passed all critical security tests and implements industry-standard security measures. Regular monitoring and updates will be necessary to maintain security standards.
