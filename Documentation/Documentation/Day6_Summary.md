   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=****
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=****
   ```

### Known Issues and Resolutions

1. **Build Optimization**

   - Issue: Initial build time > 2 minutes
   - Resolution: Optimized dependencies and build cache

2. **Environment Variables**

   - Issue: Local vs Production mismatch
   - Resolution: Standardized .env management

3. **Cache Management**
   - Issue: Stale data in production
   - Resolution: Implemented proper cache invalidation

### Next Steps
