# Day 3 Summary: Custom API Implementation & Data Migration

## Overview

Day 3 focuses on implementing a custom data flow between Supabase and Sanity CMS for our Premium Lifestyle & Footwear Marketplace. Instead of using third-party APIs, we've designed a robust, scalable architecture that leverages the strengths of both platforms.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Data Flow Architecture

- Designed bidirectional sync between Supabase and Sanity
- Implemented real-time updates using Supabase subscriptions
- Created custom hooks for data fetching and state management
- Established TypeScript interfaces for type safety

### 2. Integration Implementation

- Set up Supabase client for operational data
- Configured Sanity client for content management
- Created API routes in Next.js for data handling
- Implemented real-time sync mechanisms

### 3. Data Migration Strategy

- Developed scripts for initial data population
- Created transformation utilities for data mapping
- Implemented validation checks for data integrity
- Set up error handling and logging

### 4. Frontend Integration

- Built custom React hooks for data fetching
- Implemented real-time stock updates
- Created reusable components for product display
- Added error boundaries and loading states

## Technical Details

### Data Flow Pattern

```
Supabase (Operational Data)
  ↕ Real-time Sync
Next.js API Routes
  ↕ Content Sync
Sanity CMS (Content)
  ↕ GROQ Queries
Frontend Components
```

### Integration Points

   - Asset handling
   - GROQ queries
   - Content relationships

3. **Next.js API Routes**
   - Data aggregation
   - Request handling
   - Error management
   - Caching strategy

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Code Organization**

   - Modular architecture
   - Type safety with TypeScript
   - Clean code principles
   - Separation of concerns

2. **Performance**

   - Efficient data fetching
   - Optimized queries
   - Caching strategies
   - Real-time updates

3. **Security**
